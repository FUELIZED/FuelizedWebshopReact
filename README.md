This is a github repository for development purposes.
The end goal: a fully mobile responsive React Website + Shop with back-end for the administrators to use.

Use ```yarn start``` in the root folder to start the development server:

Use ```yarn dev --host``` to expose the server to the local network.

Things to do: 
- Finishing the menu, exactly like it was on https://fuelized.com
- Choose a nice logo, in thought with the colors of the whole websites (color palets, adobe has a nice one: https://color.adobe.com/nl/create/color-wheel
- Mobile responsivity
- Content copy from fuelized.com
- Same pages, only in react this time.
- As secure as possible
- Up-to-date YARN & packages.
- 0auth (Google & Facebook login possibility)
- User login possibility (Via 0auth would be the best)
