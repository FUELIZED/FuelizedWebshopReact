# FuelizedWebshopReact
This is a github repository for development purposes.
The end goal: a fully mobile responsive React Website + Shop with back-end for the administrators to use.

## Getting Started

Use ```yarn``` in the root folder to install all the dependencies:

Use ```yarn start``` in the root folder to start the development server:

Use ```yarn dev --host``` to expose the server to the local network.


Things to do: 
- Link a back-end utility with a login for administrator users, preferabbely with 2FA options due to security reasons
- Finishing dropdowns in the menu.
- Mobile responsivity
- Content copy from fuelized.com (Texts, images, styling & fonts.)
- As secure as possible (Hackingproof on upload)
- User login possibility (Via 0auth would be the best) Google & facebook are enough.
- For payments: Mollie or Adyen? Probably via API's
- Changing the icons from the navbar items
